## Personal Examples of Design Patterns in TypeScript

This is my personal set of notes and examples created during the course [Design Patterns in TypeScript](https://www.udemy.com/course/design-patterns-typescript/) by Sean Bradley so that I may gain a better understanding of the concepts presented.

### Design Patterns Overview

#### Creational
Abstracts the instantiation process so that there is a logical separation between how objects are composed and finally represented.

#### Structural
Focuses more on how classes and objects are composed using the different structural techniques, and to form structures with more or altered flexibility.

#### Behavioral
Are concerned with the inner algorithms, process flow, the assignment of responsibilities and the intercommunication between objects.
